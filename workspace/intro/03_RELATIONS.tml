# Every FACT begins with a predicate,
# which is also the name of a relation.
#
# We can think of:
#     relations as tables,
#     facts as rows and
#     entities as columns.
#
# Set of relations is called a model, or
# relational structure.

# FACTS (rows) in a relation (table) are
# unordered. It means it doesn't matter which
# fact comes first.
# Entities (columns) are unnamed and ordered.
# It's a difference from common relational
# databases where columns are named.
#
# Number of columns is also called ARITY.
